## Introducing Today's Project!

### What is Amazon Aurora?

Amazon Aurora is a type of relational database that is useful for large-scale applications because it uses clusters to improve performance and scalability.

### How I used Amazon Aurora in this project

In this project, I used Aurora to connect with an EC2 instance.

### One thing I didn't expect in this project was...

One thing I didn't expect in this project was how expensive it can be to run a database.

### This project took me...

This project took me 60 minutes to complete, including documentation.

### Creating an Aurora Cluster

A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into tables consisting of rows and columns. It is called relational because the rows relate to the columns in a structured way.

Aurora is a good choice for large-scale applications that require a relational database. This is because Aurora uses clusters, which provide greater efficiency and scalability.

## Halfway through I stopped!

I paused creating my Aurora database because I first need to set up an EC2 instance to connect with the Aurora database.

### Features of my EC2 instance

I created a new key pair for my EC2 instance because I want to securely connect to my EC2 instance with my Aurora database.

When I created my EC2 instance, I carefully noted the Public IPv4 DNS address, instance name, and key pair name to ensure I know what access I have with the key pair.

## Then I could finish setting up my database

Aurora uses clusters to efficiently handle large-scale applications and operations. By using clusters, the database instances are separated based on the type of operation, such as reader instances and writer instances.
