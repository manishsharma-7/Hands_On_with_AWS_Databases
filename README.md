## I'm building database solutions on AWS

In this AWS Databases series, I‚Äôm learning about building and connecting databases to applications, querying data to generate insights and visualizations, and working with different database types including relational and NoSQL. By the end of these projects, I will have developed five portfolio-worthy documentation pieces that showcase my skills. I‚Äôm learning about cloud databases because they are essential for modern applications and data management.

### What are databases?

Databases are organized collections of data that store, manage, and retrieve information efficiently.

Cloud engineers use databases to store application data, enable fast access and updates, support data analysis, and power various cloud-based services and applications.

### What do database professionals do?

Database professionals are responsible for designing, managing, and maintaining databases to ensure data is secure, accurate, and accessible. They optimize performance, handle backups, and troubleshoot issues.

The most interesting part of their job is solving complex data challenges and enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions.
